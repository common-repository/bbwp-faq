== Description ==
Create a simple and comfortable to use custom FAQs for your site.

Once the plugin is active, a new section will appear in the side bar menu. There, we will be able to add, edit or remove FAQs as if they were posts. You may give one number to each FAQ; it is always recommended numbering from 10 to 10, so we could insert new FAQs between old ones (using, for example, number 15).

We can access to those FAQs by the `/faq` route, but the plugin is prepared to be used with the `[bbwp-faq]` shortcode instead. The plugin is available at present in English and Spanish.

= Shortcode Preview =

`[bbwp-faq]`

== Installation ==

1. Install bbwp-faq either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate bbwp-faq.
3. Use the `[bbwp-faq]` shortcode where you want to show the FAQs.
4. If you wanna use the direct link (`/faq`) you'll probably need to recharge your site Permalinks.
